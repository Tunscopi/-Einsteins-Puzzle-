// Additional Constraints generation

1) Color of house[0] is YELLOW
- It can't be RED, as the ENGLISHMAN lives in RED (#2) and the NORWEGIAN lives in house[0].
- It can't be BLUE as house[1] is the BLUE house (#15)
- It can't be GREEN as GREEN is either in house[3] or house[4]. According to (#6) GREEN is on right of IVORY. Hence, it can't be house [0], or house[1], or house[2] - that would be right of BLUE. 
- It can't be IVORY as IVORY can only be in house[2] or house[3] to the left of GREEN

2) KOOL is cigarette in house[0]
- According to (#8), KOOLS are smoked in yellow house

3) HORSES are in house[1]
- According to (#12), HORSES are next to KOOLS

4) WATER is drank in house[0]
- UKRANIAN drinks tea (#4), ORANGE JUICE is drank by LUCKY STRIKE smoker (#12), MILK is drank in MIDDLE house (house [2]) (#8) and COFFEE is drank in GREEN house (#4)

5) FOX/ZEBRA is pet in house[0]
- SPANISH owns DOG(#3), HORSES are in house[1] (Already proven!), OLD GOLD smoker owns SNAILS (#7)

6) JAPANESE/UKRANIAN lives in house[1]
- NORWEGIAN lives in house[0], ENGLISHMAN lives in RED house(#2) but house[1] is BLUE, SPANISH man owns DOG(#3) but HORSES are in house[1]

7-9) According to solutions in (1) above IVORY and GREEN positions in house[2], house[3] and house[3], house[4] positions are proven. Also, RED therefore can only be in house[2] or house[4] as it can't possibly be in house[3] because it will then be impossible for GREEN to be to the immediate right of IVORY.
